\section{About this Project}
This OER Linear Algebra course was funded by the Ohio Department of Higher Education Innovation grant through the Ohio Open Ed Collaborative. 

Current materials minimally satisfy the Ohio Transfer Module TAG Guidelines.  Additional content will continue to be developed.  Furthermore, we expect to enhance the existing modules with additional interactive elements.
